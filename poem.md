#Ode to Spot
:cat: :cat: :cat:

**Felix Catus**, is your taxonomic nomenclature,  
an endothermic quadruped carnivorous by nature?  
Your visual, olfactory and auditory senses  
contribute to your hunting skills, and natural defenses.

I find myself intrigued by your subvocal oscillations,  
a singular development of *cat communications*  
that obviates your basic hedonistic predilection  
for a rhythmic stroking of your fur, to demonstrate affection.

*A tail is quite essential for your acrobatic talents*;  
you would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance.  
And when not being utilized to aide in locomotion,  
it often serves to illustrate the state of your emotion.

O Spot, the complex levels of behaviour you display  
connote a fairly well-developed cognitive array.  
And though you are not sentient, Spot, and do not comprehend,  
**I nonetheless consider you a _true and valued friend_.**
